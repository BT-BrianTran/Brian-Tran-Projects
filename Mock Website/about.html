			<p> <strong> My name is David Tran and I am the owner of this automotive repair shop, Bright Tech Auto Service! I am a sole proprietor meaning that I do all the work for Bright Tech by myself. Bright Tech was 
			opened in 2006 but I have been working with cars before then as in total I have 25 years of experience with fixing cars. I am also an expert ASE (Automotive Service Excellence) and certified technician. This 
			website was coded entirely by my son and it is the first one he has made so special thanks to him! I am proud of my son and want to be able to support him for as long as I can. <br> <br>
			
			Ever since I was young, I have always been interested and fascinated in cars. Back in Vietnam and also when I first moved to America, I had to ride a bike everywhere since my family and I could not afford a car. 
			When I finally was able to purchase my own car, I felt so accomplished. The main experience that helped inspire me to commit on becoming a mechanic and technician was the professor I had at college. Starting off,
			I struggled with fixing cars and it didn't help at the time I was still trying to get used to everything, struggling and dealing with all the difficulties of immigrating to a new country. However, my professor was
			very patient. He would spend time with me, giving extra hands on practical experience. I still remember the time he told me he admired my dedication to improve. All I wanted was to make him proud and not waste
			his efforts on me. He believed in me when no one else did which allowed me to pursue my passions and for that, I thank him. My goal of course is to help all my customers with their automotive needs. But I also 
			want to keep a positive attitude and help brighten everyone's day! </strong> </p>
